Draft Assembly Instructions:
After applying the solder paste, use a suction
tool or 3-mil (76.2Î¼m) point tweezers to place
all passive components, starting with the
smallest ones, then working up in size. Next,
use a suction tool to place the integrated
circuits. Put the board in a reflow oven to
solder the surface mount components in place.
Then, solder the through-hole components
and add the RF shields.

Finally, carefully inspect all solder
connections for short circuits or reflow
faults. Fix short circuits either by using a
soldering iron to break bridges, or 
re-soldering the connections. Solder problems
from reflowing can be fixed by re-soldering
them by hand.
